# CovidDataAnalysis

## Introduction

In this project the number of covid cases is compared with the population density of each county.The population density is not at all correlated to the number of cases but the number of deaths are correlated to the number of positive cases. Surprisingly some counties with the highest population density have the lowest number of positive cases.
